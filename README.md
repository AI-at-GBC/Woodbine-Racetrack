# Woodbine Horserace Analysis
## _Smarter Betting With Neural Networks_
Woodbine Racetrack is a long-standing institution for horse racing in Toronto, Ontario. Data on 4 years worth of its horse races [are available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/noqcks/woodbine-races), and in order to learn about neural networks, we attempted to use it to build a model that could predict the winner of a horse race.

After all, betting on a horse race can be intimating - and why are we studying AI if not to see if we can use technology to help us with problems like this?
