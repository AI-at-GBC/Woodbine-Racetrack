# Woodbine-Racetrack
Attempting to predict the winning horse using the public woodbine racetrack database

Woodbine is a very traditional racetrack in the Etobicoke neighbourhood of Toronto, Ontario.
The Woodbine's history dates back to 1881, when the Ontario jockey was established, and 1956, when the track opened with a one-mile oval track.

Betting on a horse can be intimating. Putting money in the wrong horse can lead to a huge loss of money. 

For this project, we decide to create a model that predicts which horse has more potential to be the winner based on its characteristics.
